# The Collision Algorithm

[Galperin, “Playing Pool with π (The Number π from a Billiard Point of View)”, 2003](https://www.ams.org/journals/mcom/2003-72-244/S0025-5718-03-01539-X/)


In 2003, physicist Gregory Galperin published a research paper showing how an idealized elastic collision simulation between two blocks can be used to compute digits of π. The setup is famously absurd in its inefficiency, requiring exponentially more collisions to reveal each additional digit, and it has since become known in the mathematics community as one of the most comically impractical ways to approximate π. But it’s such a weird, clever idea that you can’t help wanting to try it.

*Let’s try making it, shall we?*
